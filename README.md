 ## Jahnavi Sambaraju
Hi, I’m Jahnavi Sambaraju — a Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate with around 3 years of professional experience in both cloud engineering and software development. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and problem-solving, designing solutions that are not only reliable but also impactful.

Over the course of my career, I’ve contributed to modernizing cloud infrastructure, developing cloud-native applications, and collaborating with teams to deliver secure and efficient systems. My approach blends technical precision with a focus on scalability and long-term sustainability.

I’m also curious about Artificial Intelligence and how it can be integrated into cloud platforms to create smarter, more adaptive systems.

When I’m not immersed in technology, I enjoy reading books and drawing activities that spark creativity and help me maintain balance.
